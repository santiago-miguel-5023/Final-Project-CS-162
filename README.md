## Introduction

The rule of my game of life follows the same rules as Conway's game of life:

    1)  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
    2)  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    3)  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
    4)  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Documentation


   ```python
   """
   Brief assignment description.

   Longer, more detailed explanation of your solution. This may be anywhere from
   a couple of sentences to several paragraphs depending on how complex the
   assignment is. It should be detailed enough that someone who has never seen the
   code can understand what it does just by reading this explanation. You may
   also want to include examples of using the program if it accepts command line
   arguments.
